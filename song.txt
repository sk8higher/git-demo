In the backseat of a car
With a girl that has a scar,
Predicting that we won't get far,
If I would throw up we could share,
But have no expectations
------------------------------------
I can see clearly when I'm drunk,
I have no expectations,
I promised fear, but let you down,
I have no obligations.
When I see children to be ground,
I have no expectations.
When out in space you will miss sound.
